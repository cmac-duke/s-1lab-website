Members of S-1 previously adopted Neuroskyâ€™s EEG-reader headset technology for speculative projects in post-cinematic aesthetics and media philosophy. Luke Caldwell designed interactive modules that utilize the MindWave headset. The intention was to establish a networking platform that woulg enable multiple headsets to engage in a single artifact, whether that be a video conference, a continuously manipulated video as it streams, an audio file, or something else entirely.
