Critical thinking on technology/human relationship in Artificial Neural Networks and surveillance. Herbert Marcuse and Walter Benjamins were the theoretical interest during a bachelor's in Philosophy and a master's in Communications. Marcuse's theory on the aesthetical dimension was an attempt to address the problem of form and content from Marx's and Freud's ideas. Benjamin's concept of sensorium, very few mentioned in his writing, is nevertheless powerful to understand his analysis of the human-technology relationship, especially in the case of visual technologies as aesthetical experiences. A second master's in Digital Humanities was the opportunity to engage in theory and practical strategies to think in control and surveillance human-machine relationships, focused on artificial neural networks classification models. In the Computational Media, Arts and Cultures PhD I have proposed a philosophical enquire about the epistemological and ontological dimensions of classification, understood as a political practice of colonialism and capital extractivism. In an agonistic dialogue between theory and practice, this proposal is intertwined in a practical reflection on political times/spaces of artificial neural networks surveillance systems resistance. Persons' classification in machine learning models is the concrete computer practice where technology/human aesthetical relationships will be analyzed, projecting possible artificial neural networks visual counter-culture strategies of political action.
