Rachel Tay is a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Graduate Program in Literature. Her research generally spans the intersection of media theory and aesthetics, as well as the philosophies of mind, embodiment, and cognition. Specifically, it pursues a longue durée of three recurring “structures of distraction” pervasive throughout contemporary culture and critiques of media: streams, speculation, and simulation. Her work can be found in *Post45 Contemporaries* and is forthcoming in *Techno-Orientalism Vol. II*.
