## Lunch with S-1 at Frontier
### 12pm on 2/25 in the Blue Ridge room

Please join us for an interactive workshop (free lunch!) that will explore the challenging question of how to do nothing. Over the course of 45 minutes, we will look at a range of creative models and collectively imagine what doing nothing could mean to each of us.
